Database entities:
- User (id, username, password, email, paintings, favourites)
-Painting (id, name, author, style, owner, imageUrl, votes)
- FavouritePainting (id, name, author, owner, imageUrl, createdOn)

Notes:
- Use UUID or Long for ids.
Enforce validation constraints in entities (length, not-null, email contains @).
Persist with Spring Data JPA to MySql.
